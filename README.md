# GDPR Hack Day at MIT Media Lab

**Join business, legal and technology thought leaders to learn about and discuss the General Data Privacy Regulation.  This new European Law provides individuals strong ownership and control of their personal data through powerful new rights and other legal mechanisms.** 

We will hold a joint panel discussion with the “Privacy Information: explanations in algorithmic systems” session of the Data Control: Data Portability & Privacy Information Rights sister event happening at the same time in London, UK.  We will also review and discuss open source projects and emerging technologies designed to achieve one or more requirements of the GDPR. During the second part of the event we will break into smaller groups to pursue more focused discussions and project hacking based on interests of participants.  

* May 24, 2018 from 11:30 AM - 4:30 PM 
* At the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/contact/directions.html) in Room 514b and adjoining window foyer breakout group space.

[Nick Naraghi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicknaraghi), Co-Founder of [TeamMachine](http://TeamMachine.ai), will demo how real-time, data-driven systems can be applied to measure the performance and effectiveness of law and regulation using the GDPR as an anchor example.  We will explore how law and policy makers can evaluate success of GDPR implementation and how individuals can use quantitative collective decision making for tracking and measuring how their data is being used, discovery of best practices for personal data management and comparing how they stand across different services and providers.

# OPTIONAL FinTech Connect Session

### 6:00 PM to 6:45 PM - Venture Cafe FinTechConnect Flash Talk

Participants are invited to continue the conversation on personal data ownership at the [Venture Cafe FinTech Connect "FlashTalk"](http://vencaf.org/fintechconnect) at 1 Braodway, Cambridge MA (2 blocks from the MIT Media Lab).  

> **FlashTalk Title: Identity and Personal Data as an Asset Class**

> FlashTalk Description: Personal identity involves more than money can buy, but it’s also part of an emerging digital asset class. The rise of “smart” phones, homes and cities accelerated by blockchain, smart contracts and mass-automation offer new modes for control, methods for valuation and mechanisms for exchange of key rights to this new asset type. What are the key issues, options, and opportunities for innovative FinTech products, services and markets arising from this new digital asset class?
